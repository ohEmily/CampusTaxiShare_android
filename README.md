RallyPointAndroid
=================

Rally Point is an app that allows users in a single network, e.g. the Columbia University network, to organize meet ups for ride sharing to popular destinations, such as local airports. This allows people to go places together with people e.g. from the same college as them, so that they aren't ride sharing with strangers.

A user is placed in a network based on their emaill address. They can then select a departure date+time and a destination. If a match is found, the users' emails are exchanged (or they can chat using the app?)
